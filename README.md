# Procedural Materials
Procedural materials library. Materials made with Blender and MaterialMaker.

## Getting Started
1. To use/view these materials, the files must be uploaded to either Blender (.blend) or MaterialMaker(.ptex).
2. The materials can then be exported to Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot Engine, etc. to be used in creating a landscape for a game, cinematic, etc.

To load these materials into Material Maker, download a material .ptex file, and access the File menu in Material Maker:

Then click Load to navigate to and select your .ptex file.

Holding and dragging with middle click will allow you to pan around the node configuration, and using the scroll wheel will let you zoom in/out.

From here you will be able to observe the node configuration and make any desired changes.



## The Why?
Material creation can be an intensely laborious process when it comes to creating high resolution textures by hand. This process can become even more intensive when trying to apply a material to a 3D model. Therefore, having a process to create dynamic, procedurally generated textures that can be applied to any model with no artifacts is highly advantageous. These materials can be used by game developers or film producers to reduce their workload when creating 3D environments. In a world where time is of the essence, procedural materials are an essential addition to any developerâ€™s toolbox.
