# Procedural Materials
Procedural materials library. Materials made with Blender and MaterialMaker.

## Getting Started
1. To use/view these materials, the files must be uploaded to either Blender (.blend) or MaterialMaker(.ptex).
2. The materials can then be exported to Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot Engine, etc. to be used in creating a landscape for a game, cinematic, etc.
