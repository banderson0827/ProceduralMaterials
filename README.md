# Procedural Materials
Procedural materials library. Materials made with Blender and MaterialMaker.

## Getting Started
1. To use/view these materials, the files must be uploaded to either Blender (.blend) or MaterialMaker(.ptex).
2. The materials can then be exported to Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot Engine, etc. to be used in creating a landscape for a game, cinematic, etc.

### Blender
1. To install Blender, go to [Blender Downloads](https://www.blender.org/download/) and click the "Download Blender" button to begin the download.

2. Once downloaded, open the .exe file to run the installation wizard and follow the instructions to complete the installation process.
3. Once finished, open the Blender application from your desktop.
4. To open a .blend file in Blender, navigate to the "Open" menu option on the welcome prompt.

5. Navigate to the file you would like to open (ex: stone-floor.blend) and then click "Open".

6. Once the file is opened in Blender, to see the node-based code you must navigate to the "Shading" tab in the top menu as shown below.

7. Then, make sure the object is selected by clicking on the plane in the view and the nodes should be displayed on the bottom view.

8. Finally, if you would like to see the rendered view of the actual material, make sure to select the "Viewport Shading" option in the top right of the viewport.

### MaterialMaker
1. To install MaterialMaker, go to [MaterialMaker Downloads](https://rodzilla.itch.io/material-maker) and click "Download Now".

2. On the next screen, make sure to click "No thanks, just take me to the downloads" to proceed to the download options.

3. On the next screen, click the first download option "material_maker_1_3_windows.zip" to begin the download.

4. Once downloaded, extract the .zip file to a folder of your choice.
5. Then, open the location where you extracted to and double-click the "material_maker.exe" application file to run MaterialMaker.
6. Once MaterialMaker is opened, to open a material file, download a material .ptex file, and access the File menu in Material Maker:

7. Then click Load to navigate to and select your .ptex file.

8. Holding and dragging with middle click will allow you to pan around the node configuration, and using the scroll wheel will let you zoom in/out.

9. From here you will be able to observe the node configuration and make any desired changes.



## The Why?
Material creation can be an intensely laborious process when it comes to creating high resolution textures by hand. This process can become even more intensive when trying to apply a material to a 3D model. Therefore, having a process to create dynamic, procedurally generated textures that can be applied to any model with no artifacts is highly advantageous. These materials can be used by game developers or film producers to reduce their workload when creating 3D environments. In a world where time is of the essence, procedural materials are an essential addition to any developerâ€™s toolbox.
